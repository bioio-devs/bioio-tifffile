    """
    Naively generates the standard OME channel ID using a provided ID.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_id: str
        An image id to pull the image specific index from.
        See: `generate_ome_image_id` for more details.
    channel_id: Union[str, int]
        A string or int representing the ID for a channel.
        In the context of the usage of this function, this is usually used with the
        index of the channel.

    Returns
    -------
    ome_channel_id: str
        The OME standard for channel IDs.

    Notes
    -----
    ImageIds are usually: "Image:0", "Image:1", or "Image:N",
    ChannelIds are usually the combination of image index + channel index --
    "Channel:0:0" for the first channel of the first image for example.
